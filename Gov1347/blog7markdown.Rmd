<font size="6"><b>Blog Post 10/24/2020: How will COVID-19 Affect the 2020 Election?</b></font>

Throughout the 2020 election cycle many Democrats have said that former Vice President Joe Biden can win Texas in November, the latest being Beto O'Rourke, who tweeted on October 14th that "If Texans continue to smash voting records, Joe Biden will win Texas & the election will be over ON ELECTION NIGHT. No waiting days (weeks?) to count votes in Pennsylvania. If you want to destroy any chance Trump has to win or steal this election, then focus on Texas" [1].  A Democratic candidate has not won Texas since Jimmy Carter did in 1976, so a Biden Texas win, with its 38 electoral votes, would be a major event in the United States' electoral system [2].  Thus, this week's blog post is focused on whether demographic trend modeling can help predict if Texas goes blue this cycle.  

<font size="4"><b>Part 1: How have different states experienced the pandemic? </b></font>

In Part 1, I analyzed how the change in the white makeup of Texas from the previous presidential election affects the Texas Democratic two-party vote share.  I merged three datasets: one that includes the popular vote by state from 1948-2016, one that includes the polling average by state from 1968-2016, and one that displays state demographic data from 1990 to 2018.  I filtered this joined dataset to include elections from 1992 onward, as those are the only presidential elections that I had individual state demographic data available for.  Below is a graph of a linear model between the Democratic two-party vote share in Texas and the change in the white makeup of Texas from the previous election.

The line of best fit in this model had a y-intercept of 38.94% and a slope of -1.380.  This slope means that for every 1% increase in white people in Texas, the Democratic two-party vote share decreased by 1.38%.  It also means that every 1% decrease in white people is associated with a 1.38% increase in the Democratic two-party vote share.  The multiple R-squared on this model was 0.1669, indicating that 16.69% of the data fits the regression model.

Thus, this model is not very responsible for the variation in the Texan Democratic two-party vote share.  However, the data visualization provides interesting insights into the status of the 2020 race.  It is visible that as Texas gets more non-white, the higher the Democratic two-party vote-share gets.  If Joe Biden wants to end the Republicans 10 election cycle streak in Texas, his campaign must focus on appealing to and motivating turnout among people of color.

In Part 2, I analyzed how the change in the women makeup of Texas from the previous presidential election affects the Texas Democratic two-party vote share.  I used the same methodology as in Part 1 except my independent variable was the change in the women makeup of Texas.

The line of best fit in this model had a y-intercept of 41.39% and a slope of -8.416.  This slope means that for every 1% increase in women in Texas, the Democratic two-party vote share decreased by 8.416%.  The multiple R-squared on this model was 0.07366, indicating that this model is not very responsible for the variation in the Texan Democratic two-party vote share.  A more improved version of this model would use the change of <b> women voters </b> in Texas as the independent variable, not the change in the amount of women.  I hope to gather this data and recreate this model next week.  Since the men/women divide in Texas is based on biology, not politics, the demographic change percentage is nearly 0% for this category. 
  


<font size="4"><b>Conclusions and Sources</b></font>

For the final portion of this week's analysis, I analyzed the change between Texas' demographics in 2016 and 2018 to see how it would affect the Democratic
two-party vote share in 2020. 

<b>This week's prediction: still a Biden win. </b>
